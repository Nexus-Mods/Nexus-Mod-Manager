 *   Major.Minor.Build.Revision

 * These values are updated according to the following:
 *   1. Major.Minor follows the ANTLR release schedule
 *   2. Build is incremented each time the C# port is packaged for release (regardless

 *      the Major or Minor version is incremented.
 *   3. Revision is the Perforce changelist number associated with the release.
